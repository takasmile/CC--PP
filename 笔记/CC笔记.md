## <center>Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation
### 1.缩写
CC: Common Criteria 通用标准
### 2.CC涉及的基本概念总览
1. TOE: target of evaluation 评估目标
2. ST: security target 安全目标
3. PP: protection profiles 保护框架
4. 各概念之间的关系
- A PP is intended to be used as a “template” for an ST. That is: the PP
describes a set of user needs, while an ST that conforms to that PP describes a TOE that satisfies those needs.
- The TOE has been evaluated to meet the ST.
### 3.基本概念具体
#### 1. TOE
#### 2. ST (p65)
- Before and during the evaluation, the ST specifies “what is to be evaluated”.  
- After the evaluation, the ST specifies “what was evaluated”.   

Two roles (among many) that an ST should not fulfil are: a detailed specification, and a complete specification.   
(*ST may be a part of a complete specification, but not a complete specification itself.*)
